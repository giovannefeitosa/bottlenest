Getting Started with BottleNest!
================================

BottleNest is a versatile microservices framework for Python 3, inspired by NestJS for Node.js. With intuitive syntax and modern design patterns, it provides routing, controllers, middleware, and dependency injection. BottleNest allows for scalable, maintainable, and high-performance microservices, ideal for small-scale applications or large-scale enterprise systems in Python.

Installation

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    environment
        A structure where information about all documents under the root is
        saved, and used for cross-referencing.  The environment is pickled
        after the parsing stage, so that successive runs only need to read
        and parse new and changed documents.

    source directory
        The directory which, including its subdirectories, contains all
        source files for one Sphinx project.
